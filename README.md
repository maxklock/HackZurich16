# HackZurich16

Axa encouraged us to set things on fire.
Microsoft urged us to make use of their beautiful octopus.
Both had a hololens here, and both would have liked a game made.

We do games.

Play around in a room full of things that can burn, get drenched and have fun with the Microsoft octopus. Try out what different insurances of Axa would have reimbursed (as we all know, you set the couch on fire by accident only). Try to maximize the destroyed or reimbursed value in 2 minutes of crazy playtime.
